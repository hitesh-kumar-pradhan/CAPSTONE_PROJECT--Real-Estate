# CAPSTONE_PROJECT:- Real-Estate

In this comprehensive capstone project, the primary focus was on leveraging Data Science techniques to provide insights, predictions, and recommendations in the Real Estate domain. The project unfolds through various stages, covering data gathering, cleaning, exploratory analysis, modeling, recommendations systems, and the deployment of a user- friendly application.

**Data Gathering:**

The project commenced with the collection of real estate data, which was self-scaraped from the 99 acres website. Similar datasets from other property listing websites were also explored, ensuring a diverse and representative dateset.

**Data Cleaning and Merging:**

To prepare the dataset for analysis, a meticulous data cleanig process was undertaken, handling missing values and ensuring consistency. The data was then merged, bringing together information on houses and flates into a unified dataset.

**Feature Engineering:**

The dataset underwent feature engineering to enhance its richness and informativeness. New features, such as additional room indicates, area with type specifications, age of prossession, furnish details, and a luxury score, were introduced to provide a more detailed representation of the properties.

**Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):**

Univariate and multivariate analyses wre conducted to uncover patterns and relationships within the data. The use of Pandas Profiling facilitated a deeper understanding of data distribution and structure.

**Outlier Detection, Missing value Imputation:**

Outliers were identified and removed to ensure the robustness of subsequent analyses. Missing values, particularly in critical columns like area and bedroom, were addressed using appropriate imputation techniques.

**Feature Selection:**

Multiple feature selection techniques were employed to identify the most impactful variables for modeling. These included correlation analysis, random forest and gradient boosting feature importance , premutation importance, LASSO, resursive feature elimination, and shape.

**Model Selection and Productionalization:**

In the Model Selection and Productionalization phase, an exhaustive comparison of various regression models was conducted to determine the most effective model for predicting property prices. The process involved implementing a detailed price prediction pipeline that incorporated encoding methods, ensuring the robustness and accuracy of the chosen model. The selected model was then deployed using Streamlit, creating an intuitive and user-friendly web interface for end-users.
